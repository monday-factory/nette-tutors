Let's start the firt chapter of **{{ site.name }}** with introduction into the ecosystem around **[Nette framework][link-nette]**.

You are of course curious about where to discuss your projects, who to ask for help and where you can find examples of clean PHP code. I hope I can lead you to particular channels where you will find answers to all your questions.

## Nette Framework `-> nette.org/en`

On official [Nette Framework][link-nette] website there are plenty of documentation articles and snippets of code.

You will find here the essentials. Is there some `HTTP` layer in framework, what does the `Presenter` class, can I use a templating engine to make the `HTML` reusable and the work with it faster? Does the framework provide builders for creating `HTML` forms? Dependency Injection, Sessions, Mailing, Database, Security, Caching, Autoloading and all other interesting parts of Nette is described right there.


## Forum `-> forum.nette.org/en`

[Nette Forum][link-nette-forum] provides the best opportunity (unlike the other interactive channels) to create a topic and keep all the related history at one place. Don't be shy to create these topics! People there will welcome your questions and send their answers so you can continue in learning Nette.

You are also welcomme to contribute with your ideas and practises.

Before new version of the framework is released, there always appears a topic with pre-release notes. You can comment them, test the version and share your observations.


## Gitter `-> gitter.im/nette/nette`

If you prefere more direct way how to ask questions people in Nette comunity, use [Gitter][link-gitter] instead. There are public chat rooms and also private channels. But be aware of Gitter not tracking related messages together.


## GitHub `-> github.com/nette`

Of course Nette Framework is open source project! You can browse the code and contribute to it on [GitHub][link-github]. Framework is distributed in many separate packages, but I will cover that topic in following article.

To the contribution point - feel free to submit new pull requests and issues on [GitHub][link-github]. If your pull request gets rejected, don't be sad about it. You can try later or yo can discuss with other contributors and comunity members why is it so.


## Componette `-> componette.com`

[Componette][link-componette] puts together extensions and other vendors used in Nette. What are extensions does not have to bother you now, we will talk about it later.

In general, when you can't find particular tool natively implemented in Nette, you will probably find that tool (or extension or component or something else) on Componette.


## {{ site.name }} `-> nette-tutors.mondayfactory.com`

There are many other blogs and articles about Nette but they are mostly written in Czech because Nette framework is *made in Czech Republic*. But don't worry! After all - aren't your reading the {{ site.name }} website in english right now? :)

We will cover many topics of web development in Nette in upcomming articles. Bunch of tutorials and examples is comming!

Notice! If you haven't find desired topic, leave us an issue on [GitHub][link-nette-tutors-github] or send a pull request if you like.
